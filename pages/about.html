                <h3>Welcome to The Daily Grind, where every cup tells a story.</h3>
                <p>We started with a simple idea: to create a space that feels like a comfortable extension of your own home, serving genuinely great coffee. For us, coffee isn't just a beverage; it's a **ritual**, a **moment of pause**, and the perfect reason to connect.</p>
                <p> Our founders, Six perpetually busy IT students who needed the perfect fuel and focus for their late-night coding sessions, dreamed of a place that honors both the craft of brewing and the warmth of human connection.</p>
