        <h3>Welcome to The Daily Grind.</h3>
        <p>What started as a small dream among a group of passionate IT students has grown into a community hub for creators, thinkers, and everyday dreamers. The Daily Grind is more than just a coffee shop ‚Äî it‚Äôs a space built on inspiration, collaboration, and the love of a good cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>Each brew represents our belief that great ideas often begin with a sip ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre studying, designing, writing, or simply taking a break from the chaos of the day.</p>
